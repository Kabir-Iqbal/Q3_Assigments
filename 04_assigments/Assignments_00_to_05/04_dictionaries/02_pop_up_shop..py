# There's a small fruit shop nearby your house that you like to buy from. Since you buy several fruit at a time, you want to keep track

# Write a program that loops through a dictionary of fruits, prompting the user to see how many of each fruit they want to buy, and then 
# prints out the total combined cost of all of the fruits.
